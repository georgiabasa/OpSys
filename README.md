There are two types of exercises: drastiriotites (activities) and frontistiriakes (tutorial exercises).

In the activities:
- The first two are based on xv6 (folder xv6-master).
- The remaining activities use the Linux source code.
Each folder (OS_drastiriotita1 to OS_drastiriotita5) contains a detailed report of
the exercise with screenshots highlighting the code modifications for each
requirement, along with explanations(e.g. about system calls, interrupts, etc).
Activity 5 also includes the source code showcasing the functionality of the
developed driver.

In the tutorial exercises, code is provided for tasks involving threads and processes.
